This code is an HTML document that includes a form for uploading an image and a script to analyze the uploaded image 
using the Azure Cognitive Services API.

The HTML document includes a form with an input field for uploading an image and a button to submit the form. 
It also includes two empty containers for displaying the response and any errors that occur during the analysis.

The script included at the end of the document adds an event listener to the form's submit event. When the form is submitted, 
the script prevents the default form submission behavior, clears the response and error containers, retrieves the uploaded image, 
creates a FormData object with the image data, and then makes a POST request to the Azure Cognitive Services API using the Axios library.

The POST request includes the image data and some headers, including the API subscription key. If the request is successful, 
the response data is displayed in the response container. If an error occurs, the error message is displayed in the error container.
